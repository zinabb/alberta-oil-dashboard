                    The <strong>distribution of production values</strong> exhibits a
                    <em>multimodal pattern</em>, indicating that Alberta’s oil output has operated within
                    <strong>distinct production regimes over time</strong>. Noticeable concentration bands around
                    <strong>8.5M</strong>, <strong>15M</strong>, and <strong>18M m<sup>3</sup> per month</strong>
                    reflect recurring production levels rather than a single dominant operating range.
                    <br><br>

                    The presence of multiple peaks suggests
                    <strong>structural or seasonal shifts in production intensity</strong>,
                    potentially associated with maintenance cycles, market conditions, or operational constraints,
                    rather than random variation. Higher production clusters occur less frequently but are clearly defined,
                    indicating periods of elevated output that are episodic rather than sustained.
                    <br><br>

                    Overall, the distribution highlights that
                    <strong>production variability is regime-based</strong>,
                    with Alberta’s oil sector transitioning between lower, mid, and higher output states over time.
                    This reinforces the importance of analyzing both trend data and distribution patterns when assessing
                    production stability and forecasting future output.
