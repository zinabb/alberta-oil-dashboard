                        The visual analyses offer valuable insights into Alberta’s evolving oil production dynamics.

                        <br><br>

                        <b>Exponential Decline Curve:</b><br>
                        The theoretical exponential decline curve visualizes the typical production pattern of a depleting oil reservoir. The curve exhibits a sharp initial drop followed by a gradual tapering, capturing the natural reduction in production rates over time. While idealized, this model is critical in understanding long-term production forecasts, reserve estimations, and planning for field development. Its inclusion on the dashboard reinforces the temporal nature of well productivity and emphasizes the importance of ongoing exploration, enhanced recovery techniques, or diversification to sustain overall output.

                        <br><br>

                        <b>Correlation Matrices:</b><br>
                        Across the <b>All Time</b> dataset, there is a near-perfect positive correlation (<i>r ≈ 0.998</i>) between <b>Total Oil Production</b> and <b>Conventional Oil Production</b>, suggesting that conventional methods have historically been the primary driver of aggregate output. Meanwhile, the moderate correlation between <b>Conventional</b> and <b>Non-Conventional Oil Production</b> (<i>r ≈ 0.44</i>) implies these streams operated with limited interdependence in earlier years.

                        <br><br>

                        In contrast, filtering the data to the <b>Last 5 Years</b> reveals stronger relationships across all categories, with correlations exceeding <i>r = 0.77</i>. The correlation between <b>Conventional</b> and <b>Non-Conventional Oil Production</b> strengthens considerably (<i>r ≈ 0.78</i>), while the relationship between <b>Total Production</b> and <b>Non-Conventional Oil</b> becomes nearly perfect (<i>r ≈ 0.993</i>). These trends underscore a structural shift: non-conventional sources—particularly oil sands—are playing an increasingly central role in Alberta’s production mix. This likely reflects growing investment in non-conventional extraction methods, supported by technological advances, economic viability, and aligned policy frameworks.

                        <br><br>

                        Together, these insights suggest that Alberta's oil industry is not only becoming more integrated across extraction types but also increasingly reliant on strategic planning to manage the decline of conventional wells while scaling up non-conventional output.
