                    The combined visual analyses provide insight into both
                    <strong>asset-level production behavior</strong> and
                    <strong>system-level production relationships</strong> within Alberta’s oil sector.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Exponential Decline Curve:</strong><br>
                    The exponential decline curve illustrates the
                    <strong>typical production lifecycle of an oil well</strong>, characterized by a steep initial decline
                    followed by a progressively slower rate of decay. This pattern reflects natural reservoir depletion and
                    declining pressure over time. While the curve is illustrative rather than calibrated to a specific asset,
                    it highlights a fundamental industry reality, sustaining aggregate production requires continuous reinvestment
                    through new drilling, enhanced recovery techniques, or operational optimization, as legacy wells alone cannot
                    maintain output indefinitely.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Correlation Matrix (All Time):</strong><br>
                    Across the full historical dataset,
                    <strong>Total Oil Production</strong> exhibits an almost perfect correlation with
                    <strong>Non-Conventional Oil</strong> production, indicating that long-term changes in Alberta’s aggregate output
                    have been driven primarily by non-conventional sources. <strong>Conventional Oil</strong> shows a moderate positive
                    correlation with total production, suggesting a supporting but less dominant role in shaping long-run production trends.
                    The weaker relationship between conventional and non-conventional production implies that these streams have historically
                    followed <strong>distinct development paths</strong> rather than moving in lockstep.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Correlation Matrix (Last 5 Years):</strong><br>
                    When focusing on the most recent five years, correlations strengthen across all production categories. The relationship
                    between <strong>Conventional</strong> and <strong>Non-Conventional Oil</strong> production increases markedly, while both
                    show strong correlations with total production. This shift suggests that short-term fluctuations in Alberta’s output are
                    increasingly influenced by both production streams, reflecting more integrated operational dynamics in the near term compared
                    to the longer historical period.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Strategic Takeaway:</strong><br>
                    Taken together, these visuals highlight the contrast between
                    <strong>natural decline at the well level</strong> and
                    <strong>structural dependence on non-conventional production at the provincial level</strong>. While non-conventional oil
                    underpins Alberta’s long-term production capacity, conventional output plays a more meaningful role in short-term variability.
                    This underscores the importance of balanced investment strategies that manage decline, volatility, and long-term supply sustainability
                    simultaneously.
