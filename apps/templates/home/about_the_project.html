                <p class="card-text">
                    This dashboard was developed as a data visualization and forecasting tool to analyze Alberta’s crude oil production trends. Built using <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong>, the project utilizes <strong>Python</strong> as its primary language, complemented by <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>and <strong>Plotly</strong> for visualizations. The early development phase also included experimentation with <strong>MATLAB</strong>, later transitioning to a fully web-based framework.

                    Real-time data is sourced from the <strong>Government of Alberta’s public API</strong>, ensuring up-to-date and reliable insights. The project involved extracting raw production data directly from these APIs, followed by extensive data wrangling and time-series calculations to generate meaningful performance metrics and trend visualizations. Custom logic was implemented to compute key indicators such as <em>year-over-year changes</em>, <em>monthly growth rates</em>, <em>cumulative production</em>, <em>forecasting models</em>, and <em>correlation matrices</em>, all dynamically rendered through interactive Plotly charts.

                    My name is <strong>Zinab Bin Sumait</strong>, and this project marks the beginning of my journey into software development and data analytics. I began learning to program in <strong>January 2025</strong>, shortly after completing the <em>Introduction to the Oil and Gas Industry</em> course at <strong>Mount Royal University</strong> in <strong>December 2024</strong>. That course not only introduced me to Alberta’s energy sector but also ignited a desire to explore its complexities through data.

                    I earned my <strong>Bachelor of Commerce in International Business Strategy</strong> from the <strong>University of Calgary</strong> in <strong>June 2024</strong>. With no prior coding background, this dashboard represents my first independent development project—blending business acumen with technical execution. Through hands-on learning and self-directed study, I transformed real-time oil production data into accessible, policy-relevant insights.

                    This is more than a coding exercise; it is a reflection of how strategic thinking and data science can intersect to create meaningful impact. As I continue to grow in the fields of energy, economics, and technology, my goal is to contribute to a more informed and data-literate approach to decision-making in Alberta’s resource landscape.
