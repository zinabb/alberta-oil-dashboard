                        This dashboard was developed as a data visualization and forecasting tool to analyze Alberta’s oil production trends. Built using <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong>, the project utilizes <strong>Python</strong> as its primary language, complemented by <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>SCSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Plotly</strong> for visualizations. Early development also included experimentation with <strong>MATLAB</strong>, later transitioning to a fully interactive web-based framework.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Real-time data is sourced from the <strong>Government of Alberta’s public API</strong>, ensuring up-to-date and reliable insights. The dashboard features production KPIs, correlation matrices, forecasting models (like <em>Simple Linear Regression</em> and <em>ARIMA</em>), and industry-specific visuals like the <em>Exponential Decline Curve</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The layout follows a clean, modular design aligned with modern data storytelling principles, emphasizing usability, clarity, and policy relevance.

                        This dashboard represents both a personal milestone and a professional foundation. I embarked on my programming journey in <strong>January 2025</strong>, driven by a desire to translate economic knowledge into actionable insight. This followed the completion of my <em>Post-Degree Specialization Course regarding the Oil and Gas Industry</em> at <strong>Mount Royal University</strong> in <strong>December 2024</strong>, which illuminated Alberta’s role in the global energy landscape and sparked my passion for energy analytics.

                    <p class="card-text text-start">
                        I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Commerce in International Business Strategy</strong> from the <strong>University of Calgary</strong> (<strong>June 2024</strong>). With this academic foundation, I began independently learning to code and built this dashboard as my first technical project—a culmination of self-guided data science exploration and strategic thinking.

                    <p class="card-text text-start">
                        This work is more than a coding exercise—it is a synthesis of industry context, real-time data, modern visualization, and a <strong>deep passion for the energy industry</strong>. My goal is to bridge the divide between commercial strategy and data-driven decision making in Alberta’s resource sector—and continue growing at the intersection of <em>economics, energy, and technology</em>.
